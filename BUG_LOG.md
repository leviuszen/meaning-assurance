## Fixed Before 0.1.0

## 2026-07-21 - Test runner changed PowerShell edition

- Affected version: pre-release candidate
- Symptom: The PowerShell 7 CI job launched the test harness with PowerShell 7, but each test was then executed by Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Root cause: `tests/run-tests.ps1` hard-coded `powershell.exe` for child test processes.
- Fix or mitigation: Resolve the child executable from the current PowerShell edition and use the same engine for every test.
- Verification: All 15 tests pass under Windows PowerShell 5.1. PowerShell 7 confirmation remains a publication gate for GitHub Actions.
- Compatibility impact: Test execution now matches the shell selected by the caller.

## 2026-07-21 - README worker example used an unsupported parameter

- Affected version: pre-release candidate
- Symptom: The isolated worker quick start passed `-Title` to `New-AgentTask.ps1`, which does not expose that parameter.
- Root cause: The documentation example drifted from the script contract.
- Fix or mitigation: Remove the unsupported parameter and add a public documentation contract test.
- Verification: The documentation test checks the obsolete parameter, required safety statements, workflow state gates, PowerShell code-block syntax, and the current test count.
- Compatibility impact: Documentation-only correction; no runtime API changed.

## 2026-07-21 - Public tests executed a sibling runtime instead of candidate source

- Affected version: pre-release candidate
- Symptom: Most tests resolved `tests\..\..\agent-workbench\scripts`, so a passing suite could validate an installed sibling runtime instead of the public candidate checkout.
- Root cause: Test paths retained the private source repository's former nested layout after the public repository was flattened.
- Fix or mitigation: Resolve the repository root from `tests\..`, target its local `scripts` folder, and add a hygiene guard against parent traversal and sibling runtime markers.
- Verification: All 15 tests pass against the candidate checkout; the synthetic public example test also creates a frozen discussion bundle and an isolated worktree from candidate scripts.
- Compatibility impact: Test-only correction; release evidence now refers to the code being published.

## 2026-07-21 - Chinese documentation assertions broke Windows PowerShell 5.1 parsing

- Affected version: pre-release candidate
- Symptom: Direct Chinese string literals in `test-public-documentation.ps1` were decoded through the Windows PowerShell 5.1 code page and produced parser errors.
- Root cause: The UTF-8 test file has no BOM, while Windows PowerShell 5.1 does not reliably infer UTF-8 for non-ASCII script source.
- Fix or mitigation: Keep PowerShell test logic ASCII-only and validate the Chinese release through non-ASCII character counts, stable ASCII markers, and bounded line checks.
- Verification: The documentation contract test and all 15 repository tests pass under Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Compatibility impact: Test-only correction; the Chinese release remains UTF-8 Markdown.

## 2026-07-21 - CI launchers assumed Windows PowerShell and test source depended on local code pages

- Affected version: pre-release candidate
- Symptom: PowerShell 7 CI could not start helper scripts because it looked for `powershell.exe` under `$PSHOME`, then a Reasonix guard test looked for the wrong process name; Windows PowerShell 5.1 CI could not parse a test containing a direct Chinese path literal.
- Root cause: Five process launch points and one test fixture assumed Windows PowerShell host names, while one Unicode fixture depended on local source-code decoding.
- Fix or mitigation: Reuse the current PowerShell process executable and process name, construct the Unicode fixture from ASCII `[char]` values, and add a hygiene regression gate against hard-coded executable hosts.
- Verification: Parser checks, targeted regressions, and all 15 tests pass locally under Windows PowerShell 5.1. GitHub Actions run `29800641691` passed all 15 tests under both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.
- Compatibility impact: Helper scripts now preserve the caller's PowerShell edition; Unicode path coverage remains intact.

## 2026-07-21 - Release hygiene did not inspect ordinary personal data in Git history

- Affected version: initial `v0.1.0` repository publication
- Symptom: A superseded contact address remained readable in an earlier commit even though the current tree and secret scanner were clean.
- Root cause: The release gate scanned the current tree and secret patterns, but did not apply the public email allowlist to every reachable Git patch.
- Fix or mitigation: Recreate the repository from a validated clean root, fetch full history in CI, and scan reachable history for unexpected email addresses and private path markers without echoing the matched values.
- Verification: The rebuilt repository started from one clean root commit, the superseded commit URL returns not found, and both local history scanning and GitHub Actions validate the new history gate.
- Compatibility impact: Release-process and test-only hardening; runtime behavior is unchanged.

## Fixed Before 0.2.0

## 2026-07-28 - Markdown backticks broke a PowerShell assertion

- Affected version: local `v0.2.0` candidate only
- Symptom: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reported cascading parser errors in the deterministic demo test.
- Root cause: A Markdown code span was placed inside a double-quoted PowerShell string, allowing the closing backtick to escape the string terminator.
- Fix or mitigation: Use a single-quoted literal for Markdown text that contains backticks.
- Verification: The test file passes a PowerShell parser check and `test-run-demo.ps1` passes under Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- Compatibility impact: Test-only correction; no runtime behavior changed.

## 2026-07-28 - Public demo summaries did not match script stdout

- Affected version: local `v0.2.0` candidate only
- Symptom: README, Release, and launch drafts presented a demo-output block containing a line and labels that `Run-Demo.ps1` did not emit; the README also named only one of two confirmed evidence gaps.
- Root cause: Public summaries and script output were written separately without one canonical-output regression.
- Fix or mitigation: Add the complete evidence line to demo stdout, use the same exact summary in every public asset, and assert both stdout and all summary copies in tests.
- Verification: `test-run-demo.ps1` checks the four canonical output lines, and `test-turnaround-assets.ps1` checks the evidence and review lines across all seven public summary locations.
- Compatibility impact: The deterministic demo now emits one additional explanatory line; evidence files and final decision semantics are unchanged.
